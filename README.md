# CrossMIkey
This repository contains a Python program that simulates a classic traffic crossing game, implemented without using the Turtle graphics module.
Players control a character attempting to safely cross a busy road filled with moving vehicles. The objective is to navigate the character across the road without colliding with any vehicles, progressively increasing the challenge as the game advances.

# Features
- Score Tracking: Keep track of successful crossings to measure player performance.
- Collision Detection: Implement robust collision detection algorithms to ensure player safety and game integrity.
- Responsive Controls: Use intuitive arrow keys for character movement (up, down).
- Game Over Screen: Display a game over message when the player collides with a vehicle, providing feedback on performance.

# How to Play
# Controls:
- Use the arrow keys to move the character:
- Up arrow: Move the character upwards.
- Down arrow: Move the character downwards.

# Objective:
Navigate the character across the road, avoiding collisions with passing vehicles.
Reach the opposite side of the road safely to score points and advance in difficulty.

# Game Mechanics:
- Vehicles move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds.
- The game speeds up or increases vehicle density over time, challenging the player's reflexes and strategic planning.

# Implementation Details
- Python Version: Python 3.12
- Libraries Used: Standard Python libraries only, no external game development frameworks.
- Algorithmic Approach: Utilizes fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and basic collision detection logic.
- Modularity: Code is structured into functions and classes to promote reusability and maintainability.

# Future Enhancements
- Implement additional features like power-ups, different types of vehicles, or multiple levels.
- Enhance graphical user interface (GUI) elements for a more immersive gameplay experience.
- Introduce sound effects and background music to enrich the gaming atmosphere.

# Getting Started
- To run the game locally:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- python main.py
